Introduction:
This is a simple yet fun game involving a ball and some hanging bricks that despawn on collision with the ball. 
The objective is to finish all bricks before they reach to the bottom of the playing window.


Instructions:
1. To play, run the main.py file and select the difficulty in the main menu that pops up.
	•  Normal difficulty is the standard game.

	•  Harder difficulty has a twist that each time the ball is missed by the stick at the bottom of the screen that the player controls, 
	   there is a 1 in 3 chance of spawning 2 balls instead of 1.

2. Controls: 
	•  To control the stick, use the Right and Left arrow keys in your keyboard.

	•  To control how high the ball goes on each bounce, use space bar. When pressed, the ball goes higher than in the unpressed state.

	•  To change the direction of the ball, use the arrow keys at the time of impact between the ball and the stick. The ball inherits the speed of 
	   the stick at impact.
   
3. Conclusion of the game:
	•  The moment all bricks are cleared up, the player wins. The score board on the top left shows the score. When playing this game in a competition, 
	   lowest score would be the best score.  
	   
	•  If even a single hanging brick reaches the bottom end of the window, the player loses and the game ends.
